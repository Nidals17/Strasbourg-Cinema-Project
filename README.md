# Cinevox-project

## Presentation

The CineVox project aims to provide any cinema enthusiast with a quick tool to access the schedule of Cinema Vox in Strasbourg.

Users can navigate this application and explore the programming based on three main categories: genre, title, and projection date. This choice is made to facilitate the user's search based on their needs. If they are interested in movies categorized as "Action" or "Adventure" and so on, they can select the genre. If they are more interested in a specific film, they can search by title. Similarly, if they are concerned with the programming on a specific day, they can select "date" as a means of search.

The usage of the application has been simplified by integrating a dialogue with the user, who only needs to enter numbers to make their choices.

Regardless of the search mode used, the final result will be displayed in a table with the title, genre, date, and time of the projection of the movie(s) in question.
